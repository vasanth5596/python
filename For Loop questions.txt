
     for loop concept:---
     1. Print the first 10 natural numbers using for loop.
     2. print a multiplication table of a given number (given number is 6).
     3. write a programe to display names from a list using for loop.
     4. take months like january, february, march, april and store this month into a list and use for loop for month and if,elif,else statements
        (example:--if in a month of january we have 30days print the days of a avery months)

     5. write a programme to use for loop and nesterd for loop to print the reverse number pattern
        (example:-- a=5 and b=5 take this variables into for loop range and nesterd for loop range)
        (print output like:---5 4 3 2 1 
			      4 3 2 1 
			      3 2 1
			      2 1
			      1
     6. Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop
     7. Write a program that appends the types of elements into a empty list x=[] take another list n=["20", "python", "33.98"] and use loop.

     8. take a input number from user and print stars in trangle shape output should be:--  
         												  * 
        												 * *
       													* * *
      												       * * * *
     												      * * * * *
    												     * * * * * *
   											            * * * * * * *
                                                                                                   * * * * * * * *

    9. Write a Python program that prints each item and its corresponding type from the following list.
        example:-- datalist = [1452, 11.23, 1+2j, True, 'w3resource', (0, -1), [5, 12], {"class":'V', "section":'A'}]

    10. write a programe to accept decimal number and display its binary number.
